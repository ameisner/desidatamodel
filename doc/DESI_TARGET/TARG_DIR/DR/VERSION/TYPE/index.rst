``TYPE`` is the type of target. Types of target include "targets", "skies",
"gfas", "randoms" and "pixweight" files (files of quantities from the
random catalogs averaged across HEALPixels). Under each target type
data are grouped according to the specific DESI observational campaign.
Campaigns can include "mainX" for iterations of the DESI Main Science Survey,
"svX" for iterations of Survey Validation and "cmx" for commissioning.
