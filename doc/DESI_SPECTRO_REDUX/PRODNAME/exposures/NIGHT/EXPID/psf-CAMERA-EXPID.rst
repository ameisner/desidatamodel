psf-CAMERA-EXPID.fits
=====================

Spectrograph point spread functions (PSFs) derived from individual arc
exposures will be in
``$DESI_SPECTRO_REDUX/{prodname}/exposusures/{night}/{expid}/psf*.fits`` .
These may be combined into a nightly PSF in
``$DESI_SPECTRO_REDUX/{prodname}/calib2d/psf/{night}/{expid}/psf*.fits`` .

See that location for details on the format.
